# ðŸ“š Library Book Borrowing System (CLI + ORM)
# Overview
This command-line application simulates a basic library management system. It allows users to:
    View available books
    View registered members
    Borrow books
    Return borrowed books
    It demonstrates core backend development skills using Python, SQLAlchemy ORM, and Pipenv, while following CLI and OOP best practices.

# Features
Interactive Command-Line Interface
Three models: Member, Book, and BorrowRecord
One-to-many relationships:
    Member â†’ BorrowRecord
    Book â†’ BorrowRecord
Uses SQLAlchemy ORM to manage the database
Automatic seeding of data
Input validation for IDs and borrowing logic
Uses Python lists and dictionaries for formatting and interaction
Virtual environment managed with Pipenv
